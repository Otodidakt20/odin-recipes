    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> Biryani (/bɪrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. </p>
    <p>It is made by adding rice and spices to meat (usually chicken, goat, lamb, prawn, fish or beef). Eggs and/or vegetables, such as potatoes, are also added in certain regional varieties</p>
    <h3> From Iran to India: The journey and evolution of biriyani</h3>
    Biriyani is the quintessential celebratory dish in India and an aromatic delicacy that dazzles as a sublime one-dish meal, writes historian and food expert Pushpesh Pant.
    <br>The 400-year-old city of Hyderabad is linked in popular mind for its signature biriyani as much as it is with the exquisitely constructed Charminar monument.
    <br> The biriyani may have become a local landmark, but that doesn't stop people from asking, <strong>"Where did it come to India from and when?"</strong><br>
    There can be little doubt that biriyani originated in Iran. Even the name biriyani can be traced to the original Persian "birinj biriyan" - literally, fried rice.
    There is no evidence that biriyani first came to this land with the Moguls. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in south India.
    It was only much later that the dish meandered along less travelled roads, along the seaboard and the hinterland of the peninsula, donning different local garbs to tickle regional palates.
    <br> In present day Kerala for instance, one encounters the Malabar/Mopla biriyani. At times it substitutes meat and chicken in favour of fish or prawn. The spicing is stronger here and its proponents do not miss the aromatic symphony associated with the Hyderabadi product.

        <ul>
            <h4> Biryani:</h4>

                <li> 3 ½ cups water</li>  
                <li>2 ⅓ cups basmati rice</li> 
                <li>4 bay leaves, divided</li>
                <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
                <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
                <li>¼ cup ghee (clarified butter), divided</li>
                <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
        </ul>
    <h4> Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.</li>
        <li>  Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped.</li>
        <li>  Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside.</li>
        <li> Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and rice.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
